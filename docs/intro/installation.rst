Installation
============

D20 is a Python 3.6+ framework and is tested against Python 3.6 - 3.9 for compatibility.
It is not compatible with Python 2.x or Python 3.5 and older.
Please ensure you are running a compatible version of Python.

To install D20 simply, ``pip install`` the project directory

.. code-block:: bash

    cd d20/
    pip install .


This will install required python packages along with the ``d20`` and ``d20-shell`` commands.
